The dataset was used in a recent [tidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project.

```{r}
# download directly off tidytuesdaygithub repo

rent <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-05/rent.csv')

```


```{r skim_data}
skimr::skim(rent)

#The variable types are primarily of numeric and character data type. The character variable 'descr' has the most missing values (197542 observations being NA) followed by the variables 'address', 'lon','lat',and 'details'. All categorical variables are of character type and  numeric variables (except date and year) correspond to numeric data type.

> San Francisco is the city that has the highest percentages of rental listings between the years 2000 and 2018, falling just under 30% of total listings. Average prices of all common types of listings (between 0 and 3 bedrooms) took a hit during and after the financial crisis in 2008, and saw prices surge to more than double its pre-pandemic high in 2018, despite it levelling off post-2015. Many cities in the same Bay area saw a similar surge of rental prices for a 1-bedroom apartment, mainly for job-seekers.
>
> The surge in rental prices may be caused by high housing prices in San Francisco. Purchasing a house and renting a house act as (somewhat perfect) substitutes, diverting job-seekers' demand for houses towards rental houses. Seeing an opportunity, house-owners may be more willing to supply their houses in the rental market, hence seeing an increase in supply of rental houses. 2 and more bedroom rentals also saw prices rising, which may indicate not only job-seekers, but also families are priced out of purchasing a house, but supply has fallen far behind to soak up the increase in demand.
