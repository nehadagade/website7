Hi! My name is Neha Dagade. I was born in India and raised in Malaysia where I lived for 15 years. Having a global exposure at a young age really sparked my interest in cultural interactions which is why ever since then, I've dreamt of studying and working in a culturally vibrant environment. London especially has always been my dream city.. It's incredibly diverse, and being surrounded by people from different countries and cultures has always been important to me. I'm so grateful to finally be here, halfway across the world, living on my own, meeting new people, creating new memories and building this whole new life for myself. I'm super excited to make the most out of it and to create new lifelong connections.

I am currently pursuing my Masters in Analytics and Management at London Business School. I did my high school in Kuala Lumpur post which I completed my bachelors from St. Xaviers College, Mumbai where I majored in Economics and Statistics. After college, I worked as a Business Analyst in JPMorgan Chase & Co. for a year in the Wealth Management division.

MY STORY

I've always had an innate interest in math and was intrigued by its applications in the real world. I also realized the benefits of having a practical degree and decided to major in the two subjects which gave me a perfect blend of theory and application. During college, I was intrigued by actuarial science and how it allowed me to leverage my mathematical aptitude to solve financial implications of uncertain future events and thus decided to give the actuarial exams alongside my college studies. I learnt so much while studying for my actuarial papers, I learnt how to programme in R and really started loving it which motivated me to do a machine learning course in college. I discovered my passion for modeling and data analytics after taking multiple internships, especially being a junior machine learning engineer for a research project with Omdena and my role at JP Morgan Chase where I gained valuable experiences in using analytical tools to drive process improvements. I wish to develop my skills further and prepare myself for a strong international career in data analytics with its applications in business, finance and insurance. In pursuit of this ambition, I have come to London Business School for my masters. LBS has been a dream so far and I'm really looking forward to my journey here.

MY INTERESTS

Outside of my professional interests, I'm a huge foodie and I have the biggest sweet tooth, my million cavities will agree with me. Alongside my sister, I began a small homemade bakery service back in India. It has been a creative outlet and a stress buster for me, especially during the pandemic.Additionally, fashion, food and travel are a big part of my life. I absolutely love exploring new places and cuisines and wearing sarees is my favorite pastime.
